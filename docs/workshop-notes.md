# EcoAgents Workshop Notes

## What We Built

A simple environmental AI assistant using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore concepts. This is a learning case study, not production code.

## Key Concepts Explored

### 1. Tool Integration
- Created mock tools for environmental data
- Wired tools to an agent runtime
- Simple keyword-based routing (not LLM-based yet)

### 2. Mock-First Approach
- All tools use mock data initially
- Easy to test and develop without API keys
- Can be replaced with real APIs later

### 3. FastAPI Integration
- Simple REST API for testing
- Health checks and tool listing
- Easy local development

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate with Bedrock**: Replace keyword matching with actual LLM calls
2. **Add Real Data**: Replace one mock tool with a real API
3. **Improve Routing**: Use Bedrock to determine which tool to call
4. **Add Validation**: Better input/output schemas

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding agent â†’ tool flow
- Working with AWS Bedrock concepts
- Building environmental AI applications
- Mock-first development approach
